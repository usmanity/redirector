# redirector

A simple URL redirector for easy app deep linking when link embeds don't allow non-HTTP(S) links (like Notion and Google Docs). Use at your own risk. 

This is hosted on https://r.mhmd.us 

**How to use**

- Append any link to this path: `https://r.mhmd.us/?redirect=YOUR LINK HERE`. 
- After 5 seconds, the tab will automatically close. (This might not work if you're pasting the link yourself but when it's clicked from somewhere else, it will)

Not working? File an issue as a question and I'll be happy to take a look. I did have some DNS issues in a few rare cases.
