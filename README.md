# redirector

A simple URL redirector for easy app deep linking when link embeds don't allow non-HTTP(S) links
(like Notion and Google Docs). Use at your own risk. 

This is hosted on https://r.mhmd.us 

**How to use**

- Append any link to this path: `https://r.mhmd.us/?redirect=YOUR LINK HERE`. 
- After 5 seconds, the tab will automatically close.
(This might not work if you're pasting the link yourself but when it's clicked from somewhere else, it *should*)

**Host it yourself**
Just clone the repo and throw it up on Github Pages. It's all done using JS so you don't need to run a server etc.

**Getting help**
Not working? File an issue as a question and I'll be happy to take a look. I did have some DNS issues with some URLs.
